# My PHP CRUD with standart MVC

If you just see my CRUD only with PHP, you will not see very difference in interface or usability, but now this crud is maden with MVC (Model, View, Controller)

Like the other, this a made when I was a beginner in PHP, It's again  a CRUD, but this have a little of styles in css.

You can download this repository, install depedencies with `composer install` and open with a apache (or nginx) server in you browser, just open the src/config.php to make the config,
